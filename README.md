## FridgeGerald

Developed in less than 42 hours at a hackathon,**Do you have GUTS? 2019**.

Challenge: **SAS**, **Twillo** and **Domain.com**

Hosted on Heroku, domain by Domain.com: http://fridgegerald.me

Whenever you go for grocery shopping, do you buy a lot of items and end up throwing them because they have expired? 

**DO NOT WORRY!** FridgeGerald is here to save you! 

Whenever you buy something, just add it to your list of items using "Add Item" under "My Fridge". While adding the item, let FridgeGerald know when the product expires and what type of item it is.  

After which, FridgeGerald will keep a track of your items for you. Login anytime to know how long do you have to use any of the items in fridge. 

FridgeGerald will suggest you recipes in which you can consume the most number of close-to-expiry items.

FridgeGerald will send you an SMS (using **Twillo**) every morning. Letting you know if any of your products are going to expire by today or tomorrow. 

FridgeGerald has inbuilt endpoints which can be used as APIs. Developers can use this to create more creative products and extend the functionality of FridgeGerald further.  

Lets use our resources efficiently today, for a better tomorrow.

Ideas for further development:

1) A barcode scanner can be linked with this software. That scanner can be installed inside/outside of any fridge. Scan the barcode of an item and the item will be automatically added to the system (Expiry date will be fetched via some external API? Or some database inside the system).

2) Extend my fridge to a a shared platform in which a user donates their close-to-expiry items to someone who is going to consume it before the expiry.
